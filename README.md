# ESP8266 BLE(Bluetooth) & Wi-Fi Jammer

This project aims to develop a jammer using ESP8266 to interfere with BLE and Wi-Fi networks. The project utilizes the RF24 library to generate interference in the 2.4 GHz bands and provides user feedback via an OLED display.

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

- **NodeMCU ESP8266** (or a compatible ESP8266-based board)
- **NRF24L01+** module
- **0.96" OLED SSD1306** display
- **Connecting wires**

## ðŸ›  Required Libraries

The following libraries must be installed in Arduino IDE:

- [RF24](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24)
- [SPI](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries%2FSPI)
- [Adafruit GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)
- [Adafruit SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306)

## ðŸš€ Setup & Execution

1. **Make the connections**: Complete the hardware setup as per the table above.
2. **Install libraries**: Use **Library Manager** in Arduino IDE to install the required libraries.
3. **Upload the code**: Open `Jammer.ino` in Arduino IDE and upload it to your ESP8266 board.
4. **Power up the device**: Connect your ESP8266 to a power source. The OLED screen will display jammer information.

## ðŸ“¡ Usage

When powered on, the device starts in **"Full Attack"** mode by default.
Press the button to switch between the following modes:

**Full Attack** (Interferes with all Bluetooth, 2.4 GHz devices)

The current mode will be displayed on the OLED screen.

**Note:** You can connect external power like small lipo batteries.

**Warning:** The nRF24l01 module may become very hot during use. This does not affect operation. But it may overheat your hand :D
